# Crypocurrency Exchange API demos


## Introduction

Cryptocurrency exchanges provide APIs for users. That's great. But the offcial API documentations and examples could be confusing. And most of the examples are written in Python and shell. People like me need nodejs demos.

And to be frank, I know you don't want to RTFD. Guess what? Me neither! That's why I make thisrepository.
